## syntax

ok so i'll throw some code first then i will slowly dissect it.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

this is what a super simple hello world program looks like. it should start with the `main` function, and have some `#include` headers at the start.

### main

let's start with the main function. c++ uses curly braces `{ }` to deetermine what is inside the `main` function. all open brackets must be closed or else your code will not compile. the main function is where your code will start running, so you should also start your code here.

### libraries

the `#include` block _(a.k.a preprocessor)_ tells c++ to include this library written in angle brackets `< >`. think of it as you borrowing a book and being able to use the knowledge from that book in your code.

the `<iostream>` header file defines writing to standard input and output. we will learn its uses later on.

other libraries also exist but we will only use it for later tasks. if you want to include all libraries in the c++ standard template library, you cna do so with:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
```

keep in mind that this is a `gnu / gcc` platform dependent library and may not exist for other compilers like `clang`. in that case you will have to manually include the libraries yourself.

### input & output

writing to standard output is a necessity in any programming language. from the earlier syntax, it might look very perculiar compared to other languages, as most other languages use functions to print. in c++, it is done with the `cout` through stream operators `<<` which stream whatever is on the right side into standard output. if you would like to remember the direction, think of it as funneling input **into** `cout`.

```c++
std::cout << "Hello, World!" // your text looks like its going into cout
```

similarly, c++ also has the `cin` stream which takes in user input from the terminal.

```c++
int x;

std::cin >> x;
```

the code above will wait for the user to type in a number and press **enter**, in which case x will have the value of the input.

to demonstrate input and output, here is a program that takes a number in and prints 1 added to the number:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x;

    std::cin >> x;

    std::cout << x + 1;
}
```

and here is its runtime:

```ansi
./main
17
18
```

running the program we see that indeed it prints 1 more than our input.

#### what is `std::`?

`std` stands for _standard_ and the double colon `::` is called the scope operator. `cout` just happens to be in the standard **namespace**. to put it simply, `cout` belongs to the `std` group, which you have to access to get hold of `cout`. you may see people write:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
```

at the top of their code. this tells c++ to use the standard namespace which allows us to use cout directly,

```c++
cout << "Hello, World!"
```

without needing to write `std::`.

while this is acceptable in competitive programming, there are cases when you do want to use namespaces for organization or other various reasons. for now you may just ignore it and use `using namspace std;`

## variables

### declaration

```c++
int x;
```

that is a variable. it stores data, similar to variables in math. c++ is statically typed, which means all variables must have a type assigned to it. in this case, x is of type `int` which stands for _integer_. we'll get to the other types later.

first let us give a value to `x`:

```c++
int x = 5;
```

now `x` has a value of `5`.

let us make a new variable `count` which should be double of x.

```c++
int count = x * 2;
```

now `count` has a value of `10`.

you can also declare multiple variables on the same line (as long as they are the same type):

```c++
int x = 0, y = 13, z = x * y;
```

### types

c++ has many types. for simplicity, here are the most common ones:

#### c types

-   `int` stores an integer
-   `char` stores a single character
-   `float` stores a floating point number (numbers with decimals)
-   `double` stores high precision floats
-   `bool` stores a `true` / `false` value

#### c++ types

-   `std::string` stores an array of characters (text)

here are some examples of declarations:

```c++
int people = 5;
char letter = 'M'
float percentage = 99.5;
std::string word = "fun"
```

these are all you have to know for now. you will also learn how to manipulate variables with operators later on. there are also custom types called `struct`, but we will not get into that now.

#### what is `long` and `unsigned`?

`long` is also another type in c++, but to understand `long` we first have to understand `int`.

`int` does not actually store any number. the standard states that `int` must at least store numbers from `-32767` to `32767`, (16 bits).

`long` can be double stacked (written as `long long`), and this new type must be able to store numbers between `âˆ’9 223 372 036 854 775 807` and `9 223 372 036 854 775 807`, (64 bits).

`unsigned` tells c++ to use the sign bit (the bit that tells whether a number is positive or negative) as part of the number. this means that the range is doubled in the positive space (up to `18 446 744 073 709 551 615` for `long long`), with the disadvantage of being unable to store negative numbers.

## operators

this mostly means math equations. earlier we used the `+` operator to add `1` to a variable. here are the normal math operators in c++:

-   `+` adds the right hand side to the left
-   `-` subtracts the right hand side to the left
-   `*` multiplies the right hand side to the left
-   `/` divides the right hand side to the left

note that division on integers results in the result rounded down (e.g. `3 / 2 = 1` and not `1.5`)

there is also the modulo operator:

-   `%` gets the modulus of the left hand side with the right hand side.

an example use case would be `5 % 3 = 2`. this can be read as:

_the remainder when `5` is divided by `3` is `2`_

in addition, c++ also has the increment and decrement operators:

-   `++` increments the attributed variable by 1
-   `--` decrements the attributed variable by 1

for example:

```c++
int x = 3;

x++;
```

would make x have the value of `4`.

operators are also stackable which means that,

```c++
int x = 13 * 16 + 15 % 2
```

is valid c++ code. however, do note that operator precedence does take place in c++ (i.e `* /` over `+ -`)

## if

### syntax

if statements are written like this in c++:

```c++
if ({condition}) {
    // then do something
}
```

where `{condition}` must be a convertible true false value.

let's say we are given 2 numbers and we want to print the smaller one.

```c++
int a = 5, b = 7;

if (a < b) {
    std::cout << a;
}
else {
    std::cout << b;
}
```

in this case, the value of `a` (`5`) is less than the value of `b` (`7`), which means its true. this causes the program to prnt `a`.

if the value of `a` were bigger, let's say `19`. then the program will not print a since `19 > 5`, so it resorts to the `else` block in which it prints `b`

let's say we want to print `"same"` when both `a` and `b` have the same value. in which case, we do the following:

```c++
if (a == b) {
    std::cout << "same";
}
else if (a < b) {
    std::cout << a;
}
else {
    std::cout << ab
}
```

the `==` operator allows us the check for equality. if both `a` and `b` are the same, it returns `true` else otherwise. likewise, there is also the not equals (`!=`) operator which does the opposite.

let's tackle the problem of logic. what if we want to check if `a` and `b` are positive?

```c++
if (a > 0 && b > 0) {
    std::cout "positive!";
}
```

here we use the `&&` operator which stands for the logical _and_. the code only runs when `a` **and** `b` both conditions are satisfied (i.e both are positive).

but what if we want to check if any is positive?

```c++
if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    std::cout << "at least 1 positive";
}
```

the logical _or_ (`||`) operator allows us to check if one **or** the other condition is satisfied. if at least one of them is positive, the code runs. if both are negative, the program does not print anything.

the operators are also stackable but do take note of operator precedence. the `&&` operator will be run first before the `||` operator. make sure to wrap your conditions in brackets `( )` to ensure they get run first.

### comparison operators

here is an appendix of operators:

-   ` a > b` checks if a is more than b
-   `a < b` checks if a is less than b
-   ` a >= b` checks if a is more than or equal to b
-   `a <= b` checks if a is less than or equal to b
-   `a == b` checks if a is equal to b
-   `a != b` checks if a is not equal to b
-   `a || b` checks if a or b is true
-   `a && b` checks if a and b are true
-   `!a` get the logical **not** of a

## loops

### while

while loops run the code within them as long as a certain condition is met. for example,

```c++
int time = 15;

while (time > 0) {
    time--;
}
```

this code will subtract `1` from `time` as long as it is more than `0`. afterwards, it continues running whatever else that is in the `main` function.

if you want to loop for a specific amount of runs, you can do the inverse:

```c++
int count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    // run some code for 5 times
    std::cout << "hi\n";

    count++;
}
```

the while loop will add 1 each time it is run, since it starts from 0, it runs for a total of `5` times, when count is the value of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. note that it does not run when `count = 5` because `5` is not less than `5`. thus the above code will print `"hi"` `5` times.

### for

this code can be shortened further with a for loop. the structure of a `for` loop is as shown:

```c++
for ({run once on start}; {condition}; {run every iteration}) {
    // run some code until condition is not met here
}
```

where:

-   `{run once on start}` is code that is run once when the for loop begins
-   `{condition}` is the condition that must be satisfied for the loop to continue running
-   `{run every iteration}` is code that is run every time the loop runs

translating our code from earlier, we can convert the while loop into a for loop with the following:

```c++
for (int count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
    std::cout << "hi\n";
}
```

this tells c++ to initilize our `count` variable when the loop starts, then keep checking if `count` is less than `5`, and add `1` to count every time our loop is run. this effectively runs any code `5` times.

of course it does not have to be `5` times and you can replace the `5` with other things like variables. it doesnt even have to be a comparison at all, any true false statement will work as a condition as stated earlier.

### break & continue

let's say we want to loop over a range, but stop the loop when another condition is met. the `break` keyword overrides the loop and exits it once it gets called. an example usage would be:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 69; i++) {
    if ({condition}) {
        break;
    }
}
```

where the `{condition}` will be what _breaks_ the loop.

now let's say we want to loop over a range, but skip even numbers. the `continue` keyword allows us to skip an iteration we do not want the loop to run for.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 420; i++) {

    // if the number is even
    if (i % 2 == 0) {

        // skip it

        continue;
    }

    // if not print it
    std::cout << i << '\n';
}
```

let's say `i = 16`, then the `if` statement will run and _skip_ this iteration. the loop will increment `i` to `17`, in which `17` will get printed because it is odd.

## array

imagine a numbered table:

| no. | value |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | 14    |
| 2   | 354   |
| 3   | 5     |
| 4   | 433   |
| 5   | 356   |

now rotate the table on its side.

| no.   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | 14  | 354 | 5   | 433 | 356 |

this is all there is to an array. it is a fixed-size, sideways table that stores value by an index.

# declaration

to declare an array, simply do the following:

```c++
int {array_name}[{size}];
```

this creates an array named `{array_name}` with `{size}` entries or *elements* as it is usually called. keep in mind the array is filled with garble values as nothing is set yet. accessing values in this state will give you useless garbage.

arrays can also be declared with initial values like this:

```c++
int array[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
```

but this is hardly used.

### operators

arrays are accessed by the square bracket `[ ]` operator. to get the 1st element in the array, you do:

```c++
array[0];
```

notice how in most programming languages, the 1st element has an index of `0` (so technically it is the *zeroeth* element). this is called *zero-indexing*

now these will work exactly like variables. to set a whole array to `0`, you can use a for loop,

```c++
int array_size = 15;
int array[array_size];

for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
    array[i] = 0;
}
```

this might seem confusing at first, but keep in mind the variable `i` will go through all values starting from `0` all the way to the last index, which is `14`. thus it effectively sets all values in the array to `0`. this is also why our loops always start from 0 instead of 1.

other common use cases would be to get user input in the form of an array, in which case the `cin` stream works just as usual:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
    std::cin >> array[i];
}
```

and output as well:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
    std::cout << array[i] << '\n';
}
```

one problem with arrays is that their size will not be known at runtime. so it is good practice to keep a variable for the size of an array somewhere.
